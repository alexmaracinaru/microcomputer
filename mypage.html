        <h1><strong>Our computer</strong></h1>
        <p>
My little brother and I got our first computer ever back in 1997, and it most probably was a Pentium 3 or 4. We had nothing on it, but a few default games and some weird software.  Our first "real" game ever on that computer was "Hercules" and we played it day and night. The first chatting software was mIRC, but people used that not only for chatting, but also for sharing files such as, documents, music and videos. My mom wrote our first newspaper on that computer. It was a magazine called "Gazeta de Madrid", and it was given for free to the Romanian community living in Madrid.
